# IMU-sensor-fusion-with-linear-Kalman-filter
Reads IMU sensor data (acceleration and gyro rate) from IOS app 'Sensor stream' into Simulink model and filters the angle using a linear Kalman filter. Alternatively, the Orientation and Kalman filter function block in Simulink can be converted to C and flashed to a standalone embedded system.
