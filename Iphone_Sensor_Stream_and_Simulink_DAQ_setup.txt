1.) Download 'Sensor Stream' app for IOS
2.) On your PC, disable Windows firewall.
3.) Goto cmd prompt, check ipconfig -all and netstat -a for active connections.
4.) Connect iphone to PC by enabling the wi-fi connection and personal hotspot.
5.) Find wireless IP address of PC wireless adapter by typing ipconfig -all in cmd.
6.) The wireless LAN adapter will display the IP address and subnet mask, 
    Eg. IPv4: 172.20.10.1 and SM: 255.255.255.0
7.) Check wireless adapter connectivity by pinging the wireless connection above.
8.) Check for active comms by checking netsat -a.
9.) This will help in the setup of the IP address of the 'Sensor Stream'.
10.) In 'Sensor Stream', enter the same IP address of the PC.
     Eg. 172.20.10.1 and enter a port number.
11.) Open "Socket Sniffer" and record the local and report port adresses with their respective port numbers.
    
    E.g.

    Local address Eg. 172.20.10.1 (The local address is UDP of the simulink code)
    Remote adress 172.20.10.11 (The remote address is the wireless connection)
    Local port 58783 (may be different)
    Remote port 58960 (may be different)

10.) Open and run Simulink model. 
11.) Send IMU data from 'Sensor Stream'
12.) Run Simulink model.
13.) If a connection is setup correctly, the IMU data will display on the scopes.
14.) Monitor unfilterde and kalman angle from Scope.
15.) Adjust R and P covariances accordingly.

16.) Setup finished.
